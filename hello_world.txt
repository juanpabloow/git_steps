The basic Git syntax is program | action | destination.

The principal commands for Git are:
- git clone (followed by the URL of the SSH key)
- git status (shows files that are in the staging area and the ones that not.)
- git add (followed by the file) / (adds the file to the staging area)
- git commit -m "message" (commits the files that are in the staging area) // The -m flag is to write a message.
- git log (You should see an entry for your “Add hello_world.txt” commit. You 
           will also see details on the author who made the commit)
- git push (upload your work to the GitHub repository)
- git checkout "branch name" (It switches you to an existing branch called "branch name" in your local repository)
- git checkout -b "branch name" (This creates a new branch with the name you specify and after creating it, it automatically switches you to that new branch.)
- git push origin "branch name" (This uploads (pushes) your new branch from your local machine to the remote repository.)
