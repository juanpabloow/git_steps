It was a bad mistake to follow me darling :D.

The principal commands for Git are:
- git clone (followed by the URL of the SSH key)
- git status (shows files that are in the staging area and the ones that not.)
- git add (followed by the file) / (adds the file to the staging area)
- git commit -m "mesage" (commits the files that are in the staging area)
- git log (You should see an entry for your “Add hello_world.txt” commit. You 
           will also see details on the author who made the commit)
